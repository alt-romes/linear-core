% TODO: Write a paragraph about why this lemma has to have the same delta in the subst.
% Do we still need the $Delta = empty$ restriction?
% I think yes, and if we have $Delta = empty$ we never call delta substitution, but rather move the variable to be unrestricted and then call unr. subst. lemma
% Nevermind, I don't think there needs to be a distinction between unrestricted and empty-envs. Empty-envs can be simply trivially instantiated by Delta-var rule.
% And we needed it because the case-binder was handled differently, and its substitution when it was empty was ill-defined.
% That is no longer the case.
