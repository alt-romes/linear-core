Can we type-check

f12 x y use = case (x,y) of z { (a,b) -> use x b }

using our new-yet-undefined-ALTN rule? I think it's a requirement that this
works in order to prove preservation

In our system, everything? that is lazy in consuming resources basically is
typed using a usage environment! That's quite good.
