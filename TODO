Declarativamente posso fazer isto sem pensar na construção de usage environments.
Se tivesse os usage environments, como faria isto?
* Usar os usage environments para tipificar
* Argumentar que isto faz sentido


This is the tracking ticket for the work I'm doing for my Master's dissertation on typechecking linearity in Core.

I'm currently finishing the soundness proof for the linear type system of a Core-like language, that annotates let and letrec bound variables as well as case binders with *usage environments*, as seen in the [Minicore document](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/uploads/355cd9a03291a852a518b0cb42f960b4/minicore.pdf).

I haven't (yet?) addressed GADTs and multiplicity coercions.

The [work in progress dissertation document](https://github.com/alt-romes/linear-core-lint/blob/master/report.pdf) motivates this issue and discusses the background, what I intend to do, and a preliminary solution. Note that Chapter 3/4 are still much incomplete.
